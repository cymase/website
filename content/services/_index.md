# What we do and why we do it?

At Cymase, we help businesses and creators use mycelium, a sustainable, biodegradable material, through consultancy, workshops, and product development. 

We do this because we believe in building a future where design and industry are eco-friendly, reducing waste and pollution by using nature-based solutions. Our goal is to make sustainability accessible and impactful for everyone.
